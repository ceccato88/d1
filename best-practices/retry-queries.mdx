It is useful to retry write queries from your application when you encounter a transient [error](/d1/observability/debug-d1/#error-list). From the list of `D1_ERROR`s, refer to the Recommended action column to determine if a query should be retried.

:::note
D1 automatically retries read-only queries up to two more times when it encounters a retryable error.
:::

## Example of retrying queries

Consider the following example of a `shouldRetry(...)` function, taken from the [D1 read replication starter template](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/blob/main/d1-starter-sessions-api-template/src/index.ts#L108).

You should make sure your retries apply an exponential backoff with jitter strategy for more successful retries.
You can use libraries abstracting that already like [`@cloudflare/actors`](https://github.com/cloudflare/actors), or [copy the retry logic](https://github.com/cloudflare/actors/blob/9ba112503132ddf6b5cef37ff145e7a2dd5ffbfc/packages/core/src/retries.ts#L18) in your own code directly.

```ts
import { tryWhile } from "@cloudflare/actors";

function queryD1Example(d1: D1Database, sql: string) {
  return await tryWhile(async () => {
    return await d1.prepare(sql).run();
  }, shouldRetry);
}

function shouldRetry(err: unknown, nextAttempt: number) {
  const errMsg = String(err);
  const isRetryableError =
    errMsg.includes("Network connection lost") ||
    errMsg.includes("storage caused object to be reset") ||
    errMsg.includes("reset because its code was updated");
  if (nextAttempt <= 5 && isRetryableError) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
