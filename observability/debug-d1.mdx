D1 allows you to capture exceptions and log errors returned when querying a database. To debug D1, you will use the same tools available when [debugging Workers](/workers/observability/).

D1's [`stmt.`](/d1/worker-api/prepared-statements/) and [`db.`](/d1/worker-api/d1-database/) methods throw an [Error object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) whenever an error occurs. To capture exceptions, log the `e.message` value.

For example, the code below has a query with an invalid keyword - `INSERTZ` instead of `INSERT`:

```js
try {
    // This is an intentional misspelling
    await db.exec("INSERTZ INTO my_table (name, employees) VALUES ()");
} catch (e: any) {
    console.error({
        message: e.message
    });
}
```

The code above throws the following error message:

```json
{
	"message": "D1_EXEC_ERROR: Error in line 1: INSERTZ INTO my_table (name, employees) VALUES (): sql error: near \"INSERTZ\": syntax error in INSERTZ INTO my_table (name, employees) VALUES () at offset 0"
}
```

:::note
Prior to [`wrangler` 3.1.1](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/releases/tag/wrangler%403.1.1), D1 JavaScript errors used the [cause property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause) for detailed error messages.

To inspect these errors when using older versions of `wrangler`, you should log `error?.cause?.message`.

## Error list

D1 returns the following error constants, in addition to the extended (detailed) error message:

:::note[Retry operations]
While some D1 errors can be resolved by retrying the operation, retrying is only safe if your query is idempotent (produces the same result when executed multiple times).

Before retrying any failed operation:
- Verify your query is idempotent (for example, read-only operations, or queries such as `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`).
- Consider [implementing application-level checks](/d1/best-practices/retry-queries/) to identify if the operation can be retried, and retrying only when it is safe and necessary.

## Automatic retries

D1 detects read-only queries and automatically attempts up to two retries to execute those queries in the event of failures with retryable errors.

D1 ensures that any retry attempt does not cause database writes, making the automatic retries safe from side-effects, even if a query causing modifications slips through the read-only detection. D1 achieves this by checking for modifications after every query execution, and if any write occurred due to a retry attempt, the query is rolled back.

:::note
Only read-only queries (queries containing only the following SQLite keywords: `SELECT`, `EXPLAIN`, `WITH`) are retried. Queries containing any [SQLite keyword](https://sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html) that leads to database writes are not retried.

## View logs

View a stream of live logs from your Worker by using [`wrangler tail`](/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs#view-logs-using-wrangler-tail) or via the [Cloudflare dashboard](/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs#view-logs-from-the-dashboard).

## Report issues

* To report bugs or request features, go to the [Cloudflare Community Forums](https://community.cloudflare.com/c/developers/d1/85).
* To give feedback, go to the [D1 Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev).
* If you are having issues with Wrangler, report issues in the [Wrangler GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/new/choose).

You should include as much of the following in any bug report:

* The ID of your database. Use `wrangler d1 list` to match a database name to its ID.
* The query (or queries) you ran when you encountered an issue. Ensure you redact any personally identifying information (PII).
* The Worker code that makes the query, including any calls to `bind()` using the [Workers Binding API](/d1/worker-api/).
* The full error text, including the content of [`error.cause.message`](#handle-errors).
